# Project Title

Collab

## Problem Satement
Remote Interactions are required to collaborate on projects real-time. There are platforms which provide you with real-time screen sharing to work remotely but are packed with various disadvantages of ***privacy*** and ***data leak***. These platforms aren't centered around designing and planning of projects which our platform tackles with providing you place where such flaws are taken into consideration.
## Solution
